I deleted gradlew.bat deliberately, for I dislike Windows. (I dislike macOS too, but no way to express it here.)

This app needs to make requests to an API which requires an API key. This source code doesn't include an valid key. You need to get an API key of your own and put it in the AddBookActivity.kt file. Visit link: [https://jike.xyz/jiekou/isbn.html](https://jike.xyz/jiekou/isbn.html)
